  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <!--Where I'll go in life-->
  Where will we go in life? This question sounds so definite,
  don't you think? How could any of us really know?
  I suspect I will go to Denver first, for as I write this,
  I am in a plane traveling to the Mile High city.
  I suspect, just as I was lured to this
  location, another place will call me for some reason or another
  and I will follow. No matter how anxions, unsure, or excited I
  am, I will answer the call. My heart will guide my feet and I
  shall travel toward its beckon.

      <h3>Career</h3>

  <!--Career goals-->
  <!-- image of ginger bread crumbs -->
  To be honest, I've never been quite sure of the career I wanted to
  pursue in life. All I knew was the end goal (or the aim). However,
  a career? This notion was never something I was given the luxury of
  knowing....and then 2017 hit. A year after spending a whole lot of
  money at a high-level degree. I discovered it. I wanted to be tech.
  I mean, duh! Isn't that why I'm writing this? Isn't that why I am
  enrolled in the program? So, I guess you're asking what do I
  want to do in this career field...frankly, I don't know all of the
  different options this field provides, but I'd love to go into AI
  or VR. Thos field just sound so cool, I just want to learn how it
  works, how to help people see the visions of others, how to help
  people emphathize with others, how to connect the dots, the synapses
  between two different people so they can truly understand the other
  and be on the same page....that would be cool. Other than this, I just
  want to develop apps that would make people's every day lives easier
  so they can become more productive so they can pursue what they
  were meant to accomplish and help others achieve their own dreams.
  Sounds lofty, doesn't it? Eh, maybe it is. Lofty, but not long off.

    <h3>Education</h3>
<!--Education Goals-->
  It is my earnest belief that we never stop learning-it's the
  spice of life! The moment we stop, we die inside. We're zombified!

  ...you know, as I sit here the night before class, staring at that blinking
  cursor contemplating what to write, overwhelmed by emotion and this new plight.
  Hot hypotehtical tears stream down my face
  <br>
  My soul cries out and the air around me turns ice cold making it hard to
  breathe
  </br>
  <br>My spirit dances violently
  in frustration to the tunes of uncertainty, experience of pain, and fear.
  </br>
  Fear to fail...again, as I did just last year.
  <br>My soul cries out to a God that I am on no longer speaking to regularly.
  Crying out and feeling a void, because honestly...i feel as if he is
  not there.
  </br>
  I fear my cries fall upon deaf earnest
</br> My tears
  on the only things comforting me. Trying as I might to throw on a
  smile and tell everyone else that it is going to be alright. that
  is who i am, who I am supposed to be-the one who has hope in tomorrow
  because some fictitional charater said that tomorrow would be a
  brighter day. Why? becasue the sun will come out or becuase all
  of my fears would soon be realized and begin to melt away. It's imperative
  to come toe to toe with your insecurities-am I good enough? am i smart
  enough? Can I, me, the person staring back at me every morning in the
  mirror do this? This thing! This imposible thingof overcome not
  an obstacle, but me. My courage which I feel I hold in my throat,
  sinks to my stomach and mutates covered in bile to a trait not well
  known by me. It's starts to ache. Next it stretches it's hand to my
  tailbone and that aches, i cant sit for long, i need to move. but then
  my head begins to quake. My whole body is in an uproar, nothing can
  subside the volcano of anxiety thats errupting within. I want to turn
  away, run into a room, slam the door, and hide under a rock, but
  wouldn't that be a sin? Momma always said, its a choice. You either
  sink or swim. My education goals? I want to keep my head above water
  and prove that I can win.
