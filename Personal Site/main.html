  <!--who I am -->
  <div>
  <h2>So, who are you?</h2>
  <p>In this section we were asked to write about <em>who we are</em>.
    <br>
    <br>
    You can already start to see the heavens open up, with its crepuscualar
    rays shining on the top of some mountain not too far off in the distance
    joined by sounds of soft harps playing chorally in the background.
    <br>
    <br>
      Dude, this is just the first date!
    <br>
    <br>
    Joking aside- sure, many people may know, but isn't that the excitement,
    the joy, the point to living this life
    -to find out who we <em>really</em> are...<strong>really</strong>.
    To be able to dive deep into the deepest caverns of our souls
    to solve the philosophical, and at times enigmatic questions of:
    <ul>
      <li>What are we meant to do?</li>
      <li>Who are we supposed to help</li>
      <li>Why are we here?</li>
      <li>and How the <strong>heck </strong> do we do we do that?</li>
    </ul>
  Personally, I haven't discovered the answer to those questions
  -at least not all of them. I'm sure one day these answers will
  show themselves in some consolidated "JavaScript for Kids" podcast,
  but until that day I'm fine with taking every day
  in stride, trying to be the best version
  of myself that I can be.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>...for now, I'll settle for just making a difference.</em></strong>

  <!--Hometown-->
<div>
<h2>Where I'm from</h2>
<p>
  I'm from the largest small city in America. A little psuedo-mirage in the middle of the
  desert, founded by mobsters, and kept alive by President Hoover love for the D-word.
  A place little kids hear about, but realize once they're there there that they can't
  enjoy until they're 21. A magnet in May for people in neon colors and tutus. A
  place where you can find a slot machine in every service station and gambling
  your life's savings away in one night isn't unheard of.
  <br>
  <br>
  You guessed it!
  <br>
  As the "king" used to say, <em>"Vivaaaaaaaaa Las Vegas"</em>.
  <br>
  Thank you, thank you very much.
  <br>
  <br>
  I was born and raised in this lovely little oasis, but my has it grown.
  Growing up here allowed me to enjoy many things including hike in the mountains
  about 30 minutes away, rock climb in Red Rock Canyon 15 minutes away, and
  even cool off in Lake Mead 45 minutes away. On the weekends, my parents and I
  would make a quick 3.5 hours drive to the ocean and visit family or to the
  Grand Canyon 5 hours away. Growing up in that desert was a true delight,
  mountains in every direction, clear blue skies almost everyday, and rarely
  did the temp dip below 30 degrees, even at night during the winter.

<!--Hobbies-->
<div>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
  What is it that I like to do....I think a more facile question would be,
  "what don't I like to do?". To prevent myself from protracting this section,
  I'll break down my hobbies into categories. I love playing sports. Let's be
  honest, I love playing/watching any kind of contact sport and watching
  any sport that involves a sport(except for baseball, I'd <strong>much</strong>
  rather play baseball, but I'll definitely go to a game! Another hobby of mine
  is listening to live music:
      <ul>
        <li>Jazz</li>
        <li>Soul/Neo-Soul</li>
        <li>Motown</li>
        <li>Blues(best place in Denver is Herbs!!!!)</li>
        <li><em>(Mathematically consistent</em>)Rock(like Green Day, Portugal the Man, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
  I love like all types of Art-I could find beauty in a storm. Nature is my
  favorite virtuoso. Personally, I love to paint, create designs, props, events(yes,
  I'm including events. Have you ever created an event? You need vision!! lol). Also,
  I totally can't forget, just being out in the great outdoors, I really don't
  care what it is. If we're camping, ziplining, taking some quads for a spin-I'm game!
  I probably missed tons of things that I love to do, like dancing (SALSAAAA!!-omg, LOVE)
  ...oh, and going to random cultural events( I just love hearing about and seeing
  different perspectives. The way I figure, we're all a puzzle piece. We just need
  to put them together.), wait ...traveling!! See what I mean. I
  love to do a lot of things!! I'm just going to stop...oh, almost forgot. I'm a
  <strong>HUGE</strong> foodie.

<!--Family/Friends-->
<div>
<h2>Mis amigos es mi familia</h2>
<p>
  Or what I was attemptin to say, my friends are my family. Living out in Vegas,
  we were basically the only ones. So, many of the aunts and uncles that I have
  are not really and from all walks of life. I learned to develop solid relationships
  with my friends, from school, work, extracuricular activities, and sports.
  <br>I once heard a person declare, "if you have at least one good friend then
  your doing pretty good".
  <br>
  So I reckon I'm doing pretty good. My parents are my best friends of all,
  we're thick as theives mostly when we're not getting each others goat. My
  mom is my role model, has been ever since I can remember. She's a person of
  true virtue, she's loving, honest, and always tries to do the best she can.
  My dad, he's someone that I can always go to for support.
  <br>
  My dad's side of the family is from Charlotte, NC and my mother's side is
  just a bit more south, origianally from Louisiana, but branching out mostly
  to Houston, TX. I have two half-sisters on my dad's side. One lives in
  Charlotte, with one daughter graduating from high school this year!
  From what I hear, she is a pretty good dancer. My othe sister lives near Chicago.
  She's so sweet(I'd like to be like her one day, she's in tech too). She has 2
  daughters both in high school, I think. The eldest plays the sax while the
  youngest plays the clarinet. They're both really good, they play for their schools.
  The youngest is also very tall...and long, I think she'd be a great jumper in
  Track & Field or Volleyball.
